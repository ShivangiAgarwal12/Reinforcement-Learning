## Getting Started
Clone or download the repository into your local drive for running the project files.

### Prerequisites

Python 3x
Jupyter notebook

Ideally just install Anaconda to get above mentioned dependencies.

### Installing

Once the repository has been cloned. Just open the jupyter notebook and run either the entire notebook or each cell of the notebook.

## Deployment

Reinforcement learning is primarily about finding the value function and the policy which is optimal for a given environment. Based on the tutorial the desired environment can be created and only the policy can be deployed on real-world devices.
