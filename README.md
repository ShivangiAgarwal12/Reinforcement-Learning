Reinforcement learning for tabular solution and approximate solution methods

## Getting Started
Clone or download the repository into your local drive for running the project files.

### Prerequisites

Python 3x
Jupyter notebook

Ideally just install Anaconda to get above mentioned dependencies.

### Installing

Once the repository has been cloned. Just open the jupyter notebook and run either the entire notebook or each cell of the notebook.
