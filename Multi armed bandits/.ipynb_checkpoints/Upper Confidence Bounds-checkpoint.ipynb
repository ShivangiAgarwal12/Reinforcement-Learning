    "The epsilon greedy provides a method to choose possible actions encouraging exploration. However while choosing the actions at any given time, the method is unbiased and chooses any action with equal probability. One would expect that if an arm/action is choosen multiple times, its estimate is much better as compared to other arms/actions. This is exactly captured by the upper confidence bounds."
